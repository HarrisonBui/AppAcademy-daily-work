}

public enum OrderPriority {

}

// for geographical position of any point
class Location {
	float longitude;

}

// for the vehicles used for transportation
class Vehicle {

	int id;
	String vehicleNo;
	int capacity;
	Location current_position;
	VehicleStatus current_condition;
}

class Truck extends Vehicles{

}

class Bike extends Vehicles{
